# TODO

- [ ] Add Spark Streaming to insert data into HDFS from Kafka as rendered images for tensorflow
- [ ] Add dumb learning with tensorflow
    - One-hot vectors of # dimensions equal to characters in the alphabet for result
    - Rendered images will be recognised with a deep learning process to extract the letter
- [ ] Buy more RAM to run all of this because I can't run all of this at the same time with 8GB of RAM
    - Maybe go for Google Compute Cloud instead?
